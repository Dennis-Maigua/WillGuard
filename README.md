WillGuard is a decentralized application (DApp) leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to streamline the creation and execution of wills.
By harnessing the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain, this DApp offers users a reliable and efficient solution for managing their testamentary wishes. 
Traditional will-making processes are often cumbersome, prone to errors, and subject to legal complexities. 
The Automated Wills DApp revolutionizes this process, offering a user-friendly platform that ensures the accurate execution of testamentary wishes while maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy.

# Key Features:

- **Smart Contract Execution**: Smart contracts autonomously execute the terms of the will, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Immutable Records**: All wills are securely stored on the blockchain, safeguarding them against tampering or loss.
- **Decentralized Access**: Users can access and update their wills from anywhere in the world, without reliance on intermediaries.
- **Privacy Protection**: Encryption protocols safeguard sensitive information, granting users peace of mind regarding data security.
- **Legacy Planning Tools**: Additional features facilitate comprehensive legacy planning, including asset distribution and beneficiary management.

# Environment and Setup:

>**Note**: Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) before proceeding.

### Step 1: Open a new terminal and run the following command

```bash
cd Desktop
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dennis-Maigua/willguard.git
```

### Step 3: Change the Directory

```bash
cd willguard/application
```

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) before proceeding.

### Step 4: Install the Requirements

First, you will need to install all packages and dependencies for the project by running the following command from the terminal:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 5: Start the Metro Server

You will need to start **Metro** (the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native) by running the following command from the terminal:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 6: Start the Application

#### Method 1: 

From the terminal, press the <kbd>A</kbd> key to start the app on _Android_, or press the <kbd>I</kbd> key to start the app on _iOS_.

#### Method 2:

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project and run the following command:

- For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

- For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set it up correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within your smartphone/mobile device, or Android Studio, and Xcode respectively.
